## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a curious and dynamic Firmware and Embedded Software engineer.

Some of my projects include a Discord Bot [WIP], some 3D Prints and other Firmware code I'm working on

### Professional work
11/2023 - 07/2025 I worked on @BFFonsecaYnv

I decided to centralize all my work in this account, instead of having a separate account for work.

Most of the commits are private, but at least there's some activity.
